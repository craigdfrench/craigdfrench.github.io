Over the past five years, I have been awestruck by how incredible it is to be in the position to practice software engineering in this current age.  

When I first started my career, the realm of possibilities were limited on the size and capabilities of hardware devices. The software did interesting things, but little would "blow your mind" beyond your expectations. 

I think the tipping point was the internet going mainstream. No longer was information locked away in the vaults of Compuserve, AOL, or Bulletin Board Systems (BBS) that required expensive long distance phone calls to faraway places using a modem. 

Even when using dial up internet, the access provider was the broker to the "information superhighway", but you weren't tied to them for providing the content unlike the Compuserve and AOL days.
